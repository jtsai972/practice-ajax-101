## Details
Click on the buttons to generate 10 gifs of whatever button you pressed.

Type a new search into the search bar to give you a new button to click.

This page will remember your favorites!

## Functionality
Pages
* "images" is where you go to see new gifs
* "favorites" is where your favorites will be stored and shown

Start/Stop gifs
* You can hover over the images to see the animated gifs
* You can also click the image to toggle gif animation

Favorites
* When hovering over the images, click the star in the top right corner to save the image to your favorites
* You can remove a single favorite by pressing the star in the corner again (only on the favorites page)

Clear Buttons
 * "clear topics" will remove all the buttons that have been generated
 * "clear images" will remove all the images that have been generated
 * "clear favorites" will remove all favorites from the favorites page
 * "clear favorites history" will clear out your past favorites

 Bucket list:
 * make it so you can unfavorite on the images page as well
 * turn the localStorage into an array in case of other storage getting involved on other repository pages.
